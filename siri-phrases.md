# Siri Phrases for Disambiguation and Confirmation

Try the following voice scripts once the sample app is running:

- "Create a task called Pay taxes."
- "Create a task called Pay taxes for business."
- "Complete my Pay taxes task."  
  *Siri asks which one to complete.*
- After choosing a task, respond with "Yes" or "No" to confirm.
- "Complete my Walk the dog task."  
  *Siri confirms the action without disambiguation.*

These phrases exercise both the disambiguation flow when multiple tasks match and the confirmation dialog for a resolved task.
